Usage
Make sure you have the colors.txt file with the correct format in the same directory as this file.
Run the program by executing this script using a Python interpreter.
After the program finishes running, you will find the color_names.json file containing the converted result in JSON format.
Dependencies
This program uses the built-in JSON module in Python. No additional installations are required to run this program.

Notes
Ensure that the data format in the colors.txt file matches the expected format. Each line should contain one pair of names and colors, separated by a new line.
If you want to use a file with a different name or modify the output file, you can adjust the code according to your needs.
